# Problem Statement:- Generate a random integer from a to b. You and your friend have to guess a number between two
# numbers a and b. a and b are inputs taken from the user. Your friend is player 1 and plays first. He will have to
# keep choosing the number and your program must tell whether the number is greater than the actual number or less
# than the actual number. Log the number of trials it took your friend to arrive at the number. You play the same
# game and then the person with minimum number of trials wins! Randomly generate a number after taking a and b as
# input and donâ€™t show that to the user.
#
# Input:
# Enter the value of a
# 4
# Enter the value of b
# 13
# Output:
# Player1 :
# Please guess the number between 4 and 13
# 5
# Wrong guess a greater number again
# 8
# Wrong guess a smaller number again
# 6
# Correct you took 3 trials to guess the number
# Player 2:
#
# Correct you took 7 trials to guess the number
# Player 1 wins!
